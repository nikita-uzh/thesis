## About
This code is part of the bachelor thesis done with Microsoft Azure AI. It uses the PII Recognition Service, the Customized PII Recognition Service, and the Entity Recognition Service. Furthermore, a translation pipeline in combination with the Entity Recognition Service was tested.

## Usage Guidelines
The code does not require any initial setup apart from having Microsoft Azure AI set up. The setup is described here. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-azure-ai-resource?tabs=portal

Before running the script, the placeholders for the Azure AI setup have to be replaced by the actual values for the Language Key and the Language Endpoint.
